<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


PresenceTrack is a web application that aims to make it easier for professors to edit the presence of students in their courses. The professor can mark attendance with "yes", "no" and "not entered" in a very easy and simple way, which is also shown in the application demo. This application was created while attending the course "Web technologies" and it was important for passing this course. The focus of this application is not on the appearance of the application itself, but on its functionality. Through the course, it was necessary to present knowledge in programming backend functionality in Vanilla javascript and Node.js, which was done.
